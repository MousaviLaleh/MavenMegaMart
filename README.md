# Maven Mega Mart

### still in progress

Maven MegaMart is a multinational corporation that operates a chain of retail and grocery stores. They recently received a sample of data from a new retailer 
they’re looking to acquire, and they need to identify and deliver key insights about their sales history.<br/>
Our task is to analyze over 2 million transactions by product, household, and store to get a better understanding of the retailer’s main strengths. 
From there, you need to review the company’s discount scheme to assess whether they can expect to attract customers without losing margin. <br/>
We are using Python to:
- Read in multiple flat files efficiently.
- Join tables to provide a single source of information.
- Shape & aggregate sales data to calculate KPIs.
- Visualize the data to communicate the findings.
